# FOB-Replay
Documenting my work for a simple non-jamming replay attack using my personal vehicle.

# Notes:
This project is how I gained a basic understanding of gnuradio and software defined radios, it's basic as far as key fob attacks go, as most vehicles have rolling codes so a simple replay typically will not work. For the sake of learning gnu though I used a piece of aluminum foil to block my fob's TX.
